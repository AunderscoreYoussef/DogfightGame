A dogfighting game I made by myself. A sort of passion-project that I was inspired to make by following lectures on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I can safely say I spent a total of 20 hours making it, initially. The game was made in 3 days (so around 6 and a half hours daily) Afterwards I cleaned up the code a little, and made some "quality of life" changes. There might be more to streamline, but for the amount of code - in my opinion - it is good enough.
